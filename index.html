            I have been working as a professional software developer for about 8 years. And I'm working as a manager
            last two years. During this time, I played an
            active role in the development and maintenance of B2B and B2C products. At the same time, I had
            responsibilities for the
            technical customer support of these products.
            I took part in the software development and maintenance processes of products such as Hospital Automation
            Systems, Pacs Imaging Systems, Content Management Systems, Customer Relations Management Systems, Payment
            Systems, Applicant Tracking Systems, Product Information Management Systems.
            <br>
            <br>
            I take care to develop all projects and applications platform independent and containerized. I'm excited to
            write backend services, architecture designs and create the right deployment pipeline.
